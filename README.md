# Algorithm-Theory-UPB-Course
An "algorithm theory + data structures and algorithms" course which I took in the 3rd year of university. This repo contains all the work that I still have.<br>
Note: the program from `Programe_TA_1331b.cpp` should run properly without any errors but some algorithms are missing so nothing will be output if they're chosen. I will fix this in time.
